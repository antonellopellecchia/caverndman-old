<p>Welcome to <cite>The cavern'd man</cite>! This blog is about mathematics, physics, music, programming and writing. Well, at the moment you may not find an article for each topic, but to cover them all is my intention.<br />
The title comes from the incipit of William Blake's <cite>Europe: a prophecy</cite>: go and read it!</p>

<p>I will always believe and try to put in practice this (probably apocryphal, but it doesn't matter) quotation by Albert Einstein:</p>

<blockquote>
There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.
</blockquote>

<p>In the <a href="/archive">archive</a> page you can find all the articles written so far, while the <a href="/projects">projects</a> page contains my most important creations. Have a nice reading!</p>
